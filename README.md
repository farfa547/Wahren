## How to use
See Program.cs and rewrite the 20th line so that you can analyze your vahren scenario folder.<br/>
Run the program in the debug mode.<br/>
If there were no problem, the program will end.<br/><br/>
You have to check codes near the line which throws an exception. You might be able to find some Token struct objects there.<br/>
